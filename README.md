# Movie-recommender
This repository contains the code and datasets required to build a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques.

## Introduction

- **Project Code File**: `Collaborative_Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb`
- **Dataset Files**: `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`

## Modules Used

The following Python modules were imported and used in this project:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- datetime
- re
- sklearn
- ipywidgets
- IPython
- surprise

## Steps for Execution

To run the movie recommendation system, follow these simple steps:

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook on your system and navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. Open the `Collaborative_Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb` file.

2. **Restart and Run All**: Click on the ">>" (fast forward) option in the toolbar, or select the "Restart & Run All Cells" option from the "Kernel" menu. This will execute all the cells in the notebook.

3. **Movie Recommendation**: In the cell number 52, you can enter the name of a movie in the widget (e.g., "Toy Story") to display personalized movie recommendations.

4. **Fine-Tune Recommendations**: In cell number 59:
   - Enter the number of movies you would love to watch from the list of recommendations. Input any number from 1 to 9 (e.g., 8).
   - Enter the number of movies from the list of recommendations that you would say are irrelevant to your taste. Input any number from 1 to 9 (e.g., 2).

6. **View Outputs**: After executing all the cells, the results and outputs will be displayed, including personalized movie recommendations based on your inputs.
